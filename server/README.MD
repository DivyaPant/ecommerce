🛒 E-Commerce Backend Roadmap (MVP – MERN)
✅ Current Status

Basic Express repo created

Health API working

Firebase config integrated (auth ready, no roles)

🎯 MVP Scope (Customer Only)
Entities

User (via Firebase auth + profile info in DB)

Product

Cart

Order

Core APIs

Auth / User

 Middleware: verify Firebase token

 GET /api/user/profile → get profile

 PUT /api/user/profile → update profile

Products

 GET /api/products → list all products (with pagination & category filter)

 GET /api/products/:id → product details

 (Optional for MVP) POST/PUT/DELETE → skip for now since admin side not needed

Cart

 GET /api/cart → get user’s cart

 POST /api/cart → add product to cart

 PUT /api/cart/:itemId → update qty

 DELETE /api/cart/:itemId → remove from cart

Orders

 POST /api/orders → place order (from current cart snapshot)

 GET /api/orders → get logged-in user’s orders

 GET /api/orders/:id → order details

🗂 Suggested Folder Structure
src/
  config/          # db.js, firebase.js
  models/          # mongoose schemas (User, Product, Cart, Order)
  controllers/     # business logic
  routes/          # express routers
  middlewares/     # auth, errorHandler
  services/        # e.g. firebaseAuthService.js
  utils/           # helpers (pagination, formatters)
  app.js           # express app setup
  server.js        # entry point
tests/             # Jest/Mocha tests

📝 Standards & Practices

 Use dotenv for env configs

 RESTful endpoints (/api/...)

 Centralized error handler middleware

 Input validation (express-validator or zod)

 Pagination support for product listings

 Logging with morgan (or similar)

 Secure headers → helmet

🚀 Learning Add-Ons (post-MVP)

 Add wishlist

 Add reviews/ratings

 Stripe/Razorpay integration (payments)

 Inventory management

 Role-based access (admin features)

 Testing coverage (unit + integration)

📌 Notes for Me

Start with Products API → easiest flow to wire (route → controller → model).

Next, Auth middleware → needed for Cart & Orders.

Cart + Order flows come after that.

Keep models simple for MVP, optimize later.
